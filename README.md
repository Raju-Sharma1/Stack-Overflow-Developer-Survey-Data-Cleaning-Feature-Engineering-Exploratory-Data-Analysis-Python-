# 📊 Stack Overflow Developer Survey Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs end-to-end data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Stack Overflow Developer Survey dataset using Python.

The objective is to analyze developer trends related to:
- Professional coding experience
- Job satisfaction levels
- Remote work preferences
- Programming language popularity by region
- Education vs employment patterns

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
